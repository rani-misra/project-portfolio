Performed a linear regression analysis on Taylor Swift’s discography using Spotify’s API data to see which algorithmic factors yield the highest popularity on their platform. 

Utilized backwards selection to evaluate which predictors were most influential in model significance.

Analyzed the model for flaws such as outliers and high leverage values through checking Hat Diag H, Cook’s D, DFBETA, DFFIT, and COVRATIO values. 

Discussed limitations of the model such as differences in streaming statistics between original recordings and “Taylor’s Versions”, and the exclusion of an intercept.

Concluded that energetic factors such as high valence and danceability yield to higher outcomes in popularity on Spotify.
