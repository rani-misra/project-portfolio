Described factors associated with trends over time in the incidence and survival rates following hospital admission for myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Specifically, it is aimed to understand both the individual significance of each patient covariate as well as the overall ability of the predictors to determine survival time. 

For the modeling framework, Coxâ€™s proportional hazards (PH) model was explored using the stepwise regression technique, which yielded age and BMI as the only statistically significant predictors. For comparison, an accelerated failure time (AFT) model was also considered using age, gender, BMI, and interaction terms. The hazard ratio plots visualize the differential effects of each covariate on the risk of MI patients. 

Demonstrated the utility of these statistical techniques for medical professionals and patients alike who are looking to understand the trends and extract critical factors behind survival times from a variety of individual characteristics.
