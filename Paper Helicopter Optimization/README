Recorded flight times for 8 selected levels with varying factors and determined that the body weight and body height of the paper helicopter was statistically significant.

Estimated contributions of three random factors to overall variations in flight times and analyzed the data using nested and split modeling.

Maximized flight time by calculating the optimal dimensions with Response Surface Methodology (RSM) optimization.
