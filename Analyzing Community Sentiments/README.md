Analyzed community survey responses from the City of San Antonio to classify public sentiment toward the impact of technology using natural language processing techniques.

Developed comprehensive annotation guidelines to ensure consistent labeling of data across all possible conditions.

Achieved substantial inter-annotator agreement by calculating Fleiss' Kappa, validating the reliability of the annotations.

Engineered features using Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) and implemented a Logistic Regression model in Python, splitting data into an 80/20 training/testing set.

Optimized model performance through 5-fold cross-validation and grid search, identifying the best parameters for accurate predictions.

Delivered a highly accurate model with 96% of predictions matching true labels; macro-averaged precision of 0.97 and an F1 score of 0.94 demonstrated balanced performance across classes, even with imbalanced data
