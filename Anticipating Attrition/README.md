Utilized forward variable selection methods to create an optimal model that can predict attrition. 

Compared optimization metrics such as accuracy, recall, and AUC/ROC among a logistic model, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis to find optimal model using 75/25 test-train split and 10 fold cross validation. 

Based on significance, logistic model was chosen with 87% accuracy, 97% recall, and 65% performance. Using this model, firms can create business plans that aim to reduce the significance of variables that are more likely to lead employees to attrition. Once these practices are drafted and implemented, businesses can reproduce this analysis with latest data to test whether employee attrition was actually reduced
