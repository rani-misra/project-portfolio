Separated songs from Taylor Swift’s album, Red (Taylor’s Version), into clusters which were interpreted as subgenres using Spotify’s API data.

Analyzed R2, Between Cluster Sum of Squares, Cubic Clustering Criterion, and created a Dendogram using Ward’s minimum variance approach in SAS to distinguish how many clusters should be chosen. 

Determined that five clusters are present in the album and analyzed each cluster using comparisons of means for variables to see which variables had highest influences on each cluster.

Utilized MANOVA to ensure that the cluster means were significantly separated.
