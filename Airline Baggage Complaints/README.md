Constructed an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model using differencing and cross correlation functions to predict trends and seasonality in baggage complaints among two U.S. airlines from 2004-2010.

Created 5 year forecasts for both airlines which indicated that complaints reach a peak in the summer and winter months annually. 

Demonstrated that using statistical methods to generate forecasts would allow for the airline industry to mitigate such issues, optimize baggage handling processes, and improve customer experience
